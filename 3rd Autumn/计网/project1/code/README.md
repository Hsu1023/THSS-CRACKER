Computer Networks: Project 2 (Build Your Own Router)
====================================

In this project, you will be writing a simple router with a static routing table. Your router will receive raw Ethernet frames and process them just like a real router: forward them to the correct outgoing interface, create new frames, etc. The starter code will provide the framework to receive Ethernet frames; your job is to create the forwarding logic.

You are allowed to use some high-level abstractions, including C++11 extensions, for parts that are not directly related to networking, such as string parsing, multi-threading, etc.

For more detailed information about the project and starter code, please refer to the project spec.
